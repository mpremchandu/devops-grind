OS: elementary OS 8 (Ubuntu 24.04 base), kernel 6.14
RAM: 7.6 GB RAM, no swap configured
CPU: Intel i7-6500U (2 cores / 4 threads)
Disk: 916 GB HDD, ~4% used

Anything slow already:
- System load spikes shortly after boot
- No swap configured, so memory pressure may cause sudden process termination
- HDD storage, so IO-heavy tasks may be slower
- Normal desktop usage feels responsive
